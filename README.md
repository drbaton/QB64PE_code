folder for my QB64PE projects
- sub_killer.bas - small game written in QB64PE, on linux Lite - works fine, work also on Windows 10 and standard QB64 (don't know how on MacOS)
- png_to_csv_QB64PE.bas - code for png to csv (matrix: xy values: color) converter, later u can use date from csv as "Data" type in yours QB64 programs (in 256 color mode)
- sub.png - sample image with sprites images for png_to_csv_QB64PE.bas program (used later in game sub_killer as Data)
