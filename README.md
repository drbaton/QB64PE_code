folder for my QB64PE projects
- sub_killer.bas - small game (similar to "Sub Scan" from Atari 2600) written in QB64PE on linux Lite - works fine, also works on Windows 10 and standard QB64 (don't know how on MacOS QB64)
- png_to_csv_QB64PE.bas - code for png to csv (matrix: xy values: color) converter, later u can use date from csv as "Data" type in yours QB64 programs (in 256 color mode)
- sub.png - sample image with sprites images for png_to_csv_QB64PE.bas program (used later in game sub_killer as Data)
- QBAS_stat_library - small statistical library (QBAS_stat.bas) written in QB64PE with sample using program (qbas_stat_sample.bas) and sample data (data.csv); it include functions: ImportCSV (import data from csv to rows*columns array), Statistic (calculate basic statistic of 1D data), RegLin (calculate linear regression from XY data), Plot_XY (plot XY data), Plot_XY_Reglin (Plot XY data with linear regresion) and Plot_HIST (plot histogram of 1D array data).
